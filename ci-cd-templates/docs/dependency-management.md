# Dependency Management Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for managing dependencies across all services in the Micro-Social-Ecommerce-Ecosystem.

## 1. General Principles
- **Pin dependency versions** to avoid unexpected changes.
- **Update dependencies regularly** to receive security and bug fixes.
- **Use automated tools** for vulnerability scanning and update notifications.
- **Review and approve** new third-party libraries before adoption.

## 2. Java (Spring Boot)
- Use **Maven** (`pom.xml`) or **Gradle** (`build.gradle`) for dependency management.
- Pin versions for all dependencies.
- Use the [Spring Dependency Management Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/dependency-management-plugin/docs/current/reference/html/) for Gradle projects.
- Use [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) for automated updates.
- Run `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` (with [Gradle Versions Plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)) to check for new versions.
- Use [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) for vulnerability scanning.

## 3. Node.js
- Use **npm** (`package.json`) or **yarn** (`yarn.lock`) for dependency management.
- Pin all versions in `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- Use [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-audit) or [yarn audit](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/audit/) for security checks.
- Enable [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) for automated PRs.
- Remove unused dependencies regularly.

## 4. Python
- Use **pip** with `requirements.txt` or **poetry** (`pyproject.toml`).
- Pin all versions in `requirements.txt` or `poetry.lock`.
- Use [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) or [Safety](https://pyup.io/safety/) for vulnerability scanning.
- Use [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) for automated updates.

## 5. Third-Party Library Evaluation
- Evaluate libraries for:
  - Community support and maintenance
  - License compatibility
  - Security history
- Document rationale for adopting new libraries in project documentation.

## 6. Security and Compliance
- Run security scans in CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor for vulnerabilities using GitHub Security Alerts.
- Remove or replace deprecated or vulnerable dependencies promptly.
