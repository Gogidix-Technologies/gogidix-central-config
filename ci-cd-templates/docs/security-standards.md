# Security Standards Documentation

This document defines the security standards for all code, dependencies, infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines in the Micro-Social-Ecommerce-Ecosystem.

## 1. Secure Coding Practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Avoid logging sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII).
- Implement proper error handling and avoid exposing stack traces in production.
- Use strong, salted password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
- Enforce least privilege for all service accounts and APIs.

## 2. Dependency and Vulnerability Management
- Pin dependency versions and update regularly.
- Use automated tools (Dependabot, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) for vulnerability scanning.
- Remove or replace deprecated or vulnerable dependencies promptly.
- Review and approve new third-party libraries before use.

## 3. Infrastructure Security
- Store secrets in secure vaults (e.g., GitHub Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Use TLS/SSL for all network communication.
- Restrict network access using firewalls and security groups.
- Enable logging and monitoring for all infrastructure components.
- Regularly review and rotate credentials and secrets.

## 4. CI/CD Security
- Store all secrets in CI/CD environment variables or secret stores.
- Run security scans (SAST, DAST, dependency checks) in CI/CD pipelines.
- Use least privilege for CI/CD runners and deployment credentials.
- Require code review and approval for all pull requests.
- Enforce branch protection and signed commits.

## 5. Compliance and Data Protection
- Adhere to relevant compliance standards (PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO, etc.).
- Minimize data collection and retention; use data anonymization where possible.
- Provide mechanisms for data subject rights (access, deletion, correction).
- Document and test incident response and disaster recovery procedures.
